      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello! As you can tell from the above, I'm Sophie. I was born on the 8th of October, 2006. I come from the UK, though my family is Belarussian by blood. I know two languages: English and Russian. In the future, I want to learn a few other languages, like my mother. My hobbies are drawing and playing computer games. I am currently studying IT and am considering getting a job in the future tied with it. </p>
      <p>I have been in three schools in total. Two of them were in the UK, the third - in Belarus. My grades are above average, my average grade is 8. I'm terrible at Belarussian, though I do a bit better in Belarussian literature. Mathematics and computer class are my strong points in school.</p>
